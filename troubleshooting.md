## Here are some basic troubleshooting steps if you run into trouble
- **_Home Assistant:_**
- Once the HA files are installed you can test the basic installation using the GUI front-end thus avoiding any of the Google Voice command issues:
  - From the GUI, select a player and test the following functions and confirm they are received (using the LMS interface) on the selected player:  pause, play, next track, shuffle and repeat
  - If that works then fill out the source, artist filed and select the play artist function and ensure it gets queued to your selected player and starts playing.
  - If you got this far, sounds like to HA components are working properly
  - If the queuing functions are not functioning for either the LMS or Spotify sources (or both), confirm the shell scripts are operating properly (see troubelshooting shell commands).
